For this Mini Project several reports were created and divided into 4 views:
* Customer insight
* Customer Purchase Behavior View
* Marketing Campaigns Performance View
* Purchasing Patterns View
For each one, charts were created, measurements and metrics were extracted and data were crossed, 
  aiming to give decision makers a very complete view of the customer profile, purchasing patterns and the effectiveness of Marketing campaigns.
